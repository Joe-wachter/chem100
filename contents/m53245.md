Through our partnerships with companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students, OpenStax is working to improve access to higher education for all. OpenStax is an initiative of Rice University and is made possible through the generous support of several philanthropic foundations. Since our launch in 2012 our texts have been used by millions of learners online and over 1,091 institutions worldwide.

## About OpenStax’s Resources   {#eip-479}

OpenStax resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others: they can be customized by instructors for each class, they are a \"living\" resource that grows online through contributions from educators, and they are available free or for minimal cost.

<span data-type="title">Customization</span>OpenStax learning resources are designed to be customized for each course. Our textbooks provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build, and our resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind. Instructors can select the sections most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their classes and student body. Teachers are encouraged to expand on existing examples by adding unique context via geographically localized applications and topical connections. *Chemistry* can be easily customized using our online platform (http://cnx.org/content/col11760/latest). Simply select the content most relevant to your current semester and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of your class. *Chemistry* is organized as a collection of sections that can be rearranged, modified, and enhanced through localized examples or to incorporate a specific theme of your course. This customization feature will ensure that your textbook truly reflects the goals of your course.

<span data-type="title">Curation</span>To broaden access and encourage community curation, *Chemistry* is “open source” licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. The academic science community is invited to submit examples, emerging research, and other feedback to enhance and strengthen the material and keep it current and relevant for today’s students.

<span data-type="title">Cost</span>Our textbooks are available for free online, and in low-cost print and e-book editions.

## About *Chemistry*   {#eip-905}

*Chemistry* is designed for the two-semester general chemistry course. For many students, this course provides the foundation to a career in chemistry, while for others, this may be their only college-level science course. As such, this textbook provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of chemistry and understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most general chemistry courses. At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning. A strength of *Chemistry* is that instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.

<span data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</span>Our *Chemistry* textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general chemistry courses nationwide. We strive to make chemistry, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts of chemical science. Topics are introduced within the context of familiar experiences whenever possible, treated with an appropriate rigor to satisfy the intellect of the learner, and reinforced in subsequent discussions of related content. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from chemistry educators dedicated to the project. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-217"><span data-type="item">Chapter 1: Essential Ideas</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 2: Atoms, Molecules, and Ions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 3: Composition of Substances and Solutions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 4: Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 5: Thermochemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 6: Electronic Structures and Periodic Properties of Elements</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 7: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 8: Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 9: Gases</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 10: Liquids and Solids</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 11: Solutions and Colloids</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 12: Kinetics</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 13: Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 14: Acid-Base Equilibria</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 15: Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 16: Thermodynamics</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 17: Electrochemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 18: Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 19: Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 20: Organic Chemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 21: Nuclear Chemistry</span> </span>

<span data-type="title">Assessments That Reinforce Key Concepts </span>In-chapter **Examples** walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students to practice the skill with a “Check Your Learning” component. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems.

## Atom-First Alternate Sequencing   {#eip-428}

*Chemistry* was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures. Some instructors prefer to organize their course in a molecule-first or atom-first organization. For professors who use this approach, our OpenStax *Chemistry* textbook can be sequenced to fit this pedagogy. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and textual consistency. We recommend these shifts in the table of contents structure if you plan to create a molecule/atom-first version of this text for your students: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1170572528781"><span data-type="item">Chapter 1: Essential Ideas</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 2: Atoms, Molecules, and Ions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 6: Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 7: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 8: Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 3: Composition of Substances and Solutions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 4: Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 5: Thermochemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 9: Gases</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 10: Liquids and Solids</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 11: Solutions and Colloids</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 12: Kinetics</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 13: Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 14: Acid-Base Equilibria</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 15: Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 16: Thermodynamics</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 17: Electrochemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 18: Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 19: Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 20: Organic Chemistry</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 21: Nuclear Chemistry</span></span>
